# Project title : Substance use disorder 

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to combine data cleaning, exploratory analysis and machine learning to analyze the various features found in substance abusers, and build a model model to predict individualâ€™s likelihood to become a substance abuser. 

## Data source

Title: Patient Characteristics Survey (PCS) 2022: Persons Served by Survey Year, Region of Provider, Gender, Age Group and Race/Ethnicity
The Patient Characteristics Survey (PCS) 2022 is a dataset published by the New York State of Mental Health on 29/09/2022, and is available on data.ny.gov. 

## Steps Followed 

- Trello planification of the different steps needed to complete the project
- Export the dataset as a csv file from the website
- Use python to clean the dataset and prepare it for the exploratory analysis
- Export the clean dataset to MySQL and build a database
- Build an ERD for the different tables in the database
- Use MySQL to run queries for exploratory analysis purposes
- Use python to build plots also for exploratory analysis purposes
- Encoding the dataset to prepare for modeling 
- Build a model to predict the predisposition to substance abuse based on appropriate features 

## Deliverables

- csv file of the cleaned dataset
- Python scripts: python file 1 (DataCleaning_ExploratoryAnalysis) / Python file 2 (prepare_data_mysql)
- MySQL script: Five queries used for the project
- A README.md file containing a detailed explanation of the process followed and deliverables
